# Tumblr Themes by chynu-themes
## Themes and Pages
I create custom blog themes and page themes for Tumblr users. To view and use these themes, please keep my rules (read the *Credits* section below) in mind, and click on either the `themes` or `pages` folder above in this repository. Themes are organized alphabetically and will lead you to instructions on how to preview and install.

## Installation
Log onto your tumblr and go to settings. Click on the blog that you want to customize. There will be an "Edit Theme" button for theme customization. This will bring you to the theme customization page.

From there, click Custom Theme (Edit HTML) to paste in the theme that you have chosen. Themes in this repository are under the `theme` or `pages` directory.

## Credits
Removing the credit or tampering with the credit is forbidden for consumers of the themes in this repository. A consumer is any non-developer tumblr user who applies any of the themes in this repository to their blog. 

Per github rules, forking this repository and making personal changes is fine as long as the credit remains in tact when applying these modified themes to use. Developers may add a "edited by" credit as long as the main credit still remains.
